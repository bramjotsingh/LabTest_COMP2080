### Employee Class Definition  
A company requires a system to manage information on Employee names as outlined below. The UML for the Employee class is shown below.

#### Employee UML:  
| Employee |  
|-------------|  
| + employeeCode: string |  
| + name: string |  
| + position: string |  
| + phone: string |  
| + officeNum: int |  
| + Employee(employeeCode: string, name: string, position: string, phone: string, officeNum: int) |  

A company requires a system to manage information on objects of type Employee as outlined.  
- Note: No accessors, mutators, or other methods are required, and all state attributes are public.  

#### Task:  
Create a class Employee as outlined above and paste the code for the Employee class definition in the space provided in the submission document. [1 mark]  

---

### OrderedObjects Class Definition  
You must create a simple collection class called OrderedObjects that uses a basic array to store objects of the type Employee as defined above. The list of objects must be stored in sorted order at all times.  

- The objects must be stored in ascending order by name.  
- The maximum number of objects that can be stored is 200, and this must be set in the constructor.  
- The constructor will take no parameters.

### Methods to be Created in OrderedObjects  
(Only create these methods. No extra ones.)  

#### *Method 1: addObject*  
A method called addObject that adds an object of the type outlined above. The method must:  
- Take all the parameters required to create the Employee object.  
- Create a new object and add it ONLY if no other object exists with the same name and there is space to add it in the array.  
- Sort the array using selection sort.  
- This method returns a Boolean value to indicate a successful addition or not.  

(Hint: You may want to create and use another method first to make this more efficient and easy.)

#### *Method 2: binarySearch*  
A private method called binarySearch that takes a parameter representing an employeeâ€™s name as a search value and efficiently returns:  
- The location in the array of an object with this value if found.  
- *-1 if not found*.  

[3.5 marks]  

---

#### *Method 3: employeeExists*  
A method called employeeExists that takes a parameter representing an employee name as a search value and returns a Boolean value indicating whether or not an object with a matching employee name exists.
